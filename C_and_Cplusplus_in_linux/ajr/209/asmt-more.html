<h1>More to think about</h1>

Now that you've spent a bunch of time on the four assignments in this course,
here are a few further things to implement as (optional) exercises.

<p>
(Also see a bunch of suggested problems on various topics in
<a href="probs/">http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~ajr/209/probs/</a>.)


<h2> General </h2>

Obviously, fix any bugs or write any unimplemented parts of your programs.

<p>
Implement any obvious variations which seem interesting.


<h2> Assignment one </h2>

<p>
In addhost, sort the used IP addresses as a whole rather than considering each
octet separately, 

<p>
Alternatively, find the first free slot in the case that the IP addresses are
not contiguous (perhaps because of deleted hosts).
For example, if IP addresses 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.3 exist (only), my and
probably your addhost will use 192.168.1.4, but it could have used
192.168.1.2.  (This would be important if we have a large amount of turnover
and a smaller range of allowable IP addresses, so that reuse would be
crucial.)

<p>
(The above two suggestions conflict, but are both potentially interesting
problems to do, separately.)

<p>
("delhost", which removes a host from the database, is too trivial to be
interesting.)

<p>
Make makedhcp and/or makedns better handle the case where a file in
$HOME/hosts is unreadable, or where $HOME/hosts itself is unreadable.
(Test this by doing "chmod 0" on the file or directory, and an appropriate
chmod to make it normal again (e.g. chmod 755 for directories or 644 for plain
files).)

<p>
Write "compacthosts" which renumbers the IP addresses of all hosts so that
they are contiguous (starting from 192.168.1.1).


<h2> Assignment two </h2>

<p>
Your table.c most likely terminates as soon as any of the input files are
problematic.  Make it continue to process the rest of the input files after
calling perror(), but nevertheless the error will cause it to return a
non-zero
exit status at the end, even if the last file is processed successfully.

<p>
In mytouch.c, if the file is of zero size the algorithm of reading and writing
back a character is impossible, so there is a different strategy in which we
write one character and then truncate it away.
Produce a variant of mytouch.c in which this strategy is <i>always</i> used --
we append a character to the end of the file (whatever size the file
previously was), then ftruncate() the file to its original size.
Which version of mytouch.c is better?

<p>
Make rls.c's output more like "ls -l" in some ways.
Add some command-line options and use getopt().
(And you can add -R for recursive, and then make it not be recursive by
default.)

<p>
Use malloc() to avoid any <i>a priori</i> limit on path name length in
rls.c, but make sure that you do not have a memory leak (any allocated
memory should be freed, unless the program is about to exit).  Can you
minimize the number of malloc() calls?  (Malloc() is very slow.)


<h2> Assignment three </h2>

<p>
To avoid issues with partial read()s (of the kind we took such pains to deal
with in assignment four), the message is always a fixed size.
Use a terminator of some kind (\n will do) and write an appropriate loop such
that a line of arbitrary size is correctly read.
(Then increase the maximum line size from a paltry 80 characters to something
larger like 1024.)

<p>
If the message never comes back around the ring, the master process will wait
indefinitely for it, and it won't be possible to type in a new message to send
on its way.
Use select() between the 'frompipe' and stdin (in the master process only)
so as to enable a new message to be typed in this case.
To test your code, make the process proclist[1] discard every third message.

<p>
When you signal end-of-file, the shell prompt should follow all chatter, not
be intermingled with it.
If your assignment doesn't already get this right (test it with a larger
number, like a few hundred, to be sure), then fix it.
<br>
Note: the correct solution to this is very simple -- just rearranging your code.
No special tests or special cases or extra waits are required to make this
work; it's just a question of getting everything in the right order.


<h2> Assignment four </h2>

<p>
Add a command to the server which lists all objects and their locations.
The client is unable to invoke this command; it is a debugging command for use
in an "nc" session -- the responses from the server violate the
protocol.
(This one is intended to be the easiest, but perhaps it's too boring or seems
too random; if so, please proceed to the next instead!)

<p>
Modify server.c to add stdin into its select() file descriptor set, so that
commands can be typed on stdin.
To keep it simple for now, the only command will be a blank line, which will
list all of the connected clients (some basic information, such as the handle,
IP address).
(Or you could add a command which lists all objects and their locations, or
add both commands.)

<p>
Add the ability for players to steal an object possessed by another player.
The players must be in the same room as each other.
The command in the client in English is "steal" and a player number, and this
also is the command in the protocol (regardless of client language).
(The command in French (for lang_fr.c) would be "voler".)
<br>
The server chooses an arbitrary one of the objects possessed by the target
player and tells the client what they stole (e.g. it might say "stolen 3",
which the client would report to the user as "You stole a crumpled piece of
paper (#3)" ("Vous avez volé un papier chiffonné")).
<br>
If the player has no possessions, the server instead replies "ns", and the
client tells the user something like "There is nothing to steal."
("Il n'y a rien à voler.")
<br>
(The player stolen from is not notified in any case, but will see the absence
of the object if they type "inv", or if they attempt to do something with the
object (e.g. drop it).)
